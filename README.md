# Tic Tac Toe AI
In this project I use the Minimax algorithm from Game theory to build a Tic-Tac-Toe AI bot that will always win or draw with the opponent (you). You can choose to play as X or O.
Check out my Jupyter Notebook! (the other file).
Please note that my program doesn't use alpha-beta pruning.
