    "# Welcome to Tic-tac-toe (AI)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project I use the Minimax algorithm from Game theory to build a Tic-Tac-Toe AI bot that will always win or draw with the opponent (you). You can choose to play as X or O.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Minimax Algorithm\n",
    "Minimax algorithm is an algorithm adapted from game theory. Tic-tac-toe is a zero-sum game, i.e, one person's loss is another person's gain. So either X or O has to lose the game inorder for the other to win.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good explanation is given by this video on YouTube - https://youtu.be/l-hh51ncgDI\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, the game is played by two players, a maximiser and a minimiser. We assume that both the players always chooses the best possible outcome presented to them. The algorithm backtracks the final \"state\" of the Tic-Tac-Toe board to help either the maximiser or minimiser to make the best possible move in the current state.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, if the final state of the board is that X wins, we will give it a value of +1, if the final state is that O wins, we associate a value of -1 to it, if the final state is a draw, we will assign a value of 0 to it.\n",
    "So the maximiser always chooses a move that will result in the final state to become a +1 or a 0 if the opponent is playing well. The minimiser will always choose a move that will result the final state to become -1 or a 0 if the opponent is playing optimally.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if X starts (human) and O is the bot, then the algorithm will assign every other free space with three values, +1,0 or -1. The bot will then choose the space with the maximum value, so a space with the value +1. Note that there might be multiple spaces with the same value, however, my program chooses the first available spot. This way, even though the bot doesn't choose an easier way to win, it chooses a space that will \"trap\" the opponent. I plan on optimising the code in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now lets get started!\n"
